When people say python is the new BASIC, what they're trying to say is that it has all the benefits of BASIC as well as the power of an industrial programming language.<a class=footnote-reference href=#basic id=id1>[1]</a> Most colleges today use Python as the de facto starting language to teach people programming. I myself took the Introduction to Computer Science course from MITx, which was taught in Python (and am very thankful for that).</p> <p>However, our needs as developers have changed over the years. There have been many hardware changes that have led to the change in our needs, but the most important one is the rise of multi-core processors. Most of the languages that we've inherited from the 1990s did not have to take this into consideration and Python was no exception. The Python community chose to optimize for the single core and that was a very good decision back then.<a class=footnote-reference href=#gil id=id2>[2]</a></p> <div class=section id=more-cores> <h2>More Cores</h2> <p>Today we do not have the luxury of simply adding more speed to individual processors as the Intel FAQ on multi-core architectures explains.</p> <blockquote> <p>Through Intel’s ongoing research and development efforts at Intel, the doubling of transistors every couple of years has been maintained for forty years. But scaling out could not continue indefinitely because of several, less-friendly laws of physics. A 1993-era Intel Pentium Processor had around 3 million transistors, while today’s Intel® Itanium® 2 processor has nearly 1 billion transistors. If this rate continued, Intel processors would soon be producing more heat per square centimeter than the surface of the sun-which is why the problem of heat is already setting hard limits to frequency increases.</p> <p><cite>Why is Intel implementing multi-core architectures across its product line?</cite><a class=footnote-reference href=#intel id=id3>[3]</a></p> </blockquote> <p>A more succinct explanation found on SuperUser basically adds the increased power consumption by higher frequency processors do not make them economically viable.</p> <blockquote> <p>(...)</p> <p>As a practical example the E5640 Xeon (4 cores &#64; 2.66 GHz) has a power envelope of 95 watts while the L5630 (4 Cores &#64; 2.13 GHz) requires only 40 watts. That's 137% more electrical power for 24% more CPU power for CPU's that are for the most part feature compatible. The X5677 pushes the speed up to 3.46 GHz with some more features but that's only 60% more processing power for 225% more electrical power.</p> <p>Now compare the X5560 (2.8 GHz, 4 cores, 95 watts) with the newer X5660 (2.8 GHz, 6 cores, 95 watts) and there's 50% extra computing power in the socket (potentially, assuming that Amdahl's law being kind to us for now) without requiring any additional electrical power. AMD's 6100 series CPU's see a similar gains in aggregate performance over the 2400\8400 series while keeping electrical power consumption flat.</p> <p><cite>Helvick, in an answer to the SuperUser question titled &quot;Why multi core processors?&quot;</cite><a class=footnote-reference href=#helvick id=id4>[4]</a></p> </blockquote> <p>So now, the main issue that we have is to build efficient systems that do not only take full advantage of fast cores but systems that can orchestrate the use of multiple cores. In other words, the hardware paradigm has shifted from single cores to multiple cores, but languages like Python (and its default implementation, cPython) are optimized for the single core.</p> </div> <div class=section id=python-s-good-bits> <h2>Python's Good Bits</h2> <p>There are plenty of languages out there that allow us to take efficiently take advnantage of the new multicore world, but all languages have trade-offs. What we need is a language that has most of the good stuff python has as well as being efficiently able to handle multiple cores. So, what is great about Python?</p> <hr class=docutils> <table class="docutils footnote" frame=void id=basic rules=none> <colgroup><col class=label><col></colgroup> <tbody valign=top> <tr><td class=label><a class=fn-backref href=#id1>[1]</a></td><td>BASIC was originally designed to teach programming and had a limited set of expressions. It had no classes and many other caveats. However, it was easy to learn and a lot of people were able to master the basics of writing computer programs through it. However, Python then came along and had both the simplicity of BASIC and the mileage of an industrial programming language. This is one of the main reasons HMC (Harvey Mudd College) started using Python as the language to introduce new programmers. There's also a <a class="reference external" href=http://coffeeghost.net/2008/06/18/python-is-the-new-basic/ >2008 blog post</a> by Al Sweigart explaining this.
